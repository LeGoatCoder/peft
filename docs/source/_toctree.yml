# The code is a YAML file that defines a hierarchical structure of sections and sub-sections. 

# Each section has a title and a list of sections or local entries. 

# The title field is a string that describes the content of the section.

# The local entries are references to other sections with the same parent.

# The 'local' key indicates that the section is defined in the same YAML file.

# For example, the 'Get started' section has three sub-sections: 'ðŸ¤— PEFT', 'Quicktour', and 'Installation'.

# Each of these sub-sections is defined locally, meaning that they are also defined in the same YAML file.

- title: Get started
  sections:  # The sections field is a list of section dictionaries.
  - local: index  # Each section dictionary has a 'local' key that refers to the local section.
